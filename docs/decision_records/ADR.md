# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

> An Architectural Decision (AD) is a justified software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is
> architecturally significant. An Architecturally Significant Requirement (ASR) is a requirement that has a measurable effect on a software system’s
> architecture and quality. An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) captures a single AD and its rationale; the collection of ADRs created and
> maintained in a project constitute its decision log. All these are within the topic of Architectural Knowledge Management (AKM), but ADR usage can
> be extended to design and other decisions (“any decision record”).
